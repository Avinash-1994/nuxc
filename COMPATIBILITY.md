## Known Issues (with Workarounds)

### Issue 1: HMR breaks after circular imports
**Severity:** Minor  
**Workaround:** If HMR stops responding, run `nuxco dev --force` to restart. Break circular dependencies where possible.

### Issue 2: Windows path separator edge cases
**Severity:** Minor  
**Workaround:** Use forward slashes in config (`'./src'` not `.\\src`). This is a known Node.js path normalization issue.

### Issue 3: Large bundles (5000+ modules) may slow first cold-start
**Severity:** Minor  
**Workaround:** Warm the cache with one build: second and subsequent builds are dramatically faster (RocksDB cache).

### Issue 4: Svelte HMR resets component state
**Severity:** By Design  
**Workaround:** Move state that should persist across HMR updates to a Svelte store (`writable()`), which lives outside the component tree.

### Issue 5: SSR with Module Federation
**Severity:** Major (if you need this)  
**Status:** WIP — tracked at GitHub  
**Workaround:** Use client-side-only federation for now.
